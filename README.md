# About me

### native mobile

I love developing apps for iOS, especially with SwiftUI. I believe that it's the best developer experience that you can get.

### hybrid/cross platform mobile

I'm sceptical about hybrid/cross platform mobile development like Xamarin, React Native, Flutter and Kotlin Multiplatform.

On the one hand, those technologies tend to die out or be abandoned after a few years. 
On the other hand, they don't live up to their promises to speed up the development for both platforms, because the theoretical gained speed is counteracted by the quirks of those technologies and the problems with the compatibility to the native SDKs. They never seem to mature enough to be worth using.

In my opinion mobile apps should be written in native technologies, Swift+SwiftUI for iOS and Kotlin+Compose for Android.
A great developer experience means fast development and better quality of the end product.

# blog (kind of?)

Some of my thoughts about Swift and development on Apple's platforms, written as short blog-like articles:
